To make it work

1. create .env file in the backend and the file should contain DB_CONNECTION, PORT, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET.
2. run 'npm install' for both the client and the backend to install node_module.
4. run 'nodemon server' on the backend.
5. run 'npm start' on the client.

Good to go.
